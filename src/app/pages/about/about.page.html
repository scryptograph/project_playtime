            This app was designed as part of the Project Playtime Initiative within Analog Devices (ADI). Analog Devices is an international semiconductor company headquartered in Wilmington, MA with integrated circuit design through system level development and prototyping. ADI employs over 15000 problem solvers focused on changing the world for the better. Project Playtime was an opportunity for ADI engineers to work on a project with a community-focused and open-source goal outside normal work roles. The timeline for the project was from January 2019 through July 2019, when a team developed multiple prototypes for a partner organization in the local community. Multiple Project Playtime teams worked on different projects across the globe at ADI locations including Beijing China, Limerick Ireland, Boston Massachusetts and Greensboro North Carolina. Each Project Playtime team worked with a partner organization who served as the selected community organization. The Swtich Sidekick was developed by the Project Playtime team based in Greensboro, North Carolina and the chosen partner group was After Gateway.
